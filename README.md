```
### Solution
- private/log1.text
- Need to pull the data from the backend. This error caused since I pushed the data to the backend <br>
and didn't pull the data from the cloud storage that unsync data between them

## 3.
### Issue
- The files in /public/images are not deployed.
- There are files uploaded in github repo but not deployed to Amplify.
### Solution
- Downsiz the image file from 8MB to 512KB

## 4.
### Issue
- emailjs works on local but didn't on server
### Suspect
- yarn might not work with emailjs, because .yml file for docker using the yarn not npm.
- There will be a email service on AWS in a serverless lambda way

### Solution
